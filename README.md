# Unexpected Sort Behavior with Mixed Types in TypeScript's Array.sort()

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common issue in TypeScript involving the `Array.sort()` method when dealing with arrays containing mixed data types (e.g., numbers and strings).  The standard comparison function doesn't account for this scenario consistently, leading to unexpected sorting results.

## The Problem

TypeScript's type system is flexible enough to allow an array to contain various types. However, when using `sort` with a custom comparison function, this flexibility can cause issues if the comparison function doesn't explicitly handle type checking.  This results in the strings and numbers being compared in a way that doesn't provide a correct ordering, as the `sort` function treats the strings lexicographically (alphabetically) instead of numerically.

## Solution

The solution involves adding explicit type checking and handling to the comparison function to properly handle mixed types or enforce a consistent type within the array using type guards or type assertions, ensuring that comparisons always occur between consistent numerical types or string types.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.ts` to see the code exhibiting the unexpected behavior.
3. Compile and run the code. You will observe that the array is not sorted as expected.
